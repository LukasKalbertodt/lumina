Lumina is a C++ OpenGL graphics library with the following design principles:
* *lightweight*: Just provide features which are necessary 
* *modern*: Use C++11 features where it's appropriat (Maybe using C++14 features in future versions)
* *render-pipeline-abstraction*: Make it easy to use the OpenGL pipeline but don't provide high level functions like game engines would
* *little-to-zero-overhead*: Don't do anything that the user may not want to do


This is the first working release of lumina and there is a lot more work to do. Everything can change in newer versions. The first major version (1.0) will have a fixed API that won't change anymore.
